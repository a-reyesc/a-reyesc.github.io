### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.

* Lab 2

    Lab 02, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first time
    I wrote a small and simple game.  In this lab I learned to properly work
    with variables, as well as user input via the std::cin, and printing out
    text using std::cout.
