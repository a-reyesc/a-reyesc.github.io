### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 02, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first time
    I wrote a small and simple game.  In this lab I learned to properly work
    with variables, as well as user input via the std::cin, and printing out
    text using std::cout. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it gave me an insight
    to what a game code looks like.  I was able to write and solidify my 
    understanding of for loops with various nested if statements and work 
    with bool variables.  

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was another one of my favorite labs because it was another
    mini game. In this lab I gained experience in opening and reading a file
    for a secret number.  Because it was a game, I enjoyed running the programs
    and checking their output (testing the programs).
